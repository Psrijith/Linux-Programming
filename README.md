# What is Linux Programming?

If we were to take Linux and condense it down to the most basic definition, it would be described as a completely open-source operating system kernel. Linux is also one of the most widely used operating systems for server-side applications. Linux is highly adaptable, which means as a kernel, its uses and applications are practically limitless. 

Linux has extended beyond its identity as an operating system and has evolved into a culture and ecosystem all it’s own. While Linux is one of the most popular operating systems, it still somewhat pales in comparison to Windows and Mac OS for desktop computing applications. This has created a misconception that Linux system programming is a fringe technology, when in fact, the opposite is exact. Linux OS is one of the most utilized, powering some of the most significant and most essential infrastructures in the digital world. Linux programming is among the top skillsets for individuals looking for career opportunities as either a back or frontend developer. 

While Linux system programming can be learned by almost anyone and is often used by individuals looking for a way to wedge into a free or low-cost operating system, there are some complexities to gaining skills in Linux programming. Among these complexities are the frequent updates and releases. On the surface, Linux programming is relatively easy to learn. However, the kernel is more complex and demands a wider breadth of knowledge in programming and developing. Linux programming mastery is indeed an incredible asset, and among the skills that can boost a developer’s salary. It’s also a skill set that’s best learned after acquiring a foundation of knowledge and hands-on experience. 

 
# Basic Concepts to Linux Programming 

One of the most basic foundations of knowledge for Linux programming is experience with the C programming language. C is the basis of the Linux Kernel, so an exceptional understanding and ability to use C in practical applications is critical. 

Additionally, it’s also necessary to become familiar with Linux from both the perspective of a developer and as a user. The range of functionality and adaptability to Linux demands a full spectrum perspective of its potential uses and applications. 

# Uses for Linux Programming

Of the benefits of a Linux operating system, one of the most important is its usability. Generally speaking, once you become familiar with Linux programming, developing and working with a Linux operating system is a relatively user-friendly experience. Some of the key benefits of a Linux OS include:

It’s open-source, which makes it easily modifiable by anyone with sufficient programming knowledge 
Linux OS is a budget-friendly option, with a seemingly endless list of applications and programs —many of them low cost or completely free
Linux has a reputation of being one of the most stable and reliable operating systems, being capable of running for extended periods while demanding little in terms of maintenance
In an age where cybersecurity is a major concern, a Linux operating system ranks among the most secure, with a global community that’s continually focused on building upon its strength as a secure system
Considering all of this, it only makes sense that corporate giants depending on their operating systems, choose Linux. We’re talking about digital giants that see an almost unimaginable amount of traffic daily, companies like Facebook, Amazon, and even the mighty Google.
